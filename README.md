Source code for the article: [Streaming Scenes Workflow in Unity.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/streamlining-scenes-workflow-unity-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2583-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582)

The Editor script that I posted in this article helped me reduce the time spent searching for the right scene in the project, and I am sure that it can help you improve work efficiency and improve the quality of projects in Unity. You can always improve this script by adding your own functions, or create your own script for scenes that better suits your needs. I hope that this article will be useful for use in your future projects.
